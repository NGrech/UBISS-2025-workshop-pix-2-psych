> [!NOTE] **Description:**
> - Uses smartphone data (activity, GPS) to detect unhealthy behaviors (sedentary patterns, frequent visits to unhealthy locations like bars/fast food) and recommends alternative activities.
> - Tracks user follow-up and habit formation over time

High implementation feasibility for within  the workshop but **low** novelty, the addition of gamification and adaptive features like real time habit support will increase that. 
## Variations for novelty 

### 1A. Contextually-Aware Habit Interventions

- Detect inactivity / unhealthy location visits
- Trigger LLM-generated interventions in context
- Simple user feedback

### 1B. Gamified Behavioral Dashboard

- Track habits: activity, location diversity
- Display streaks, badges
- Adaptive LLM motivational messages

### 1C. Reflective Behavioral Journaling

- Auto-generate daily summaries of behavior
- LLM reflective journal entries
- Promote user self-awareness
