=== GPT Response ===

### 1. Agent Evaluation  
User was not successful in limiting social media usage to 2 hours.  
This is a case of *Both negative*.

### 2. Feedback Message  
It looks like today's social media usage exceeded the goal you set for yourself. It's great that you're reflecting on this and are determined to improve. Recognizing the gap between your intention and outcome is an important step toward change. Remember, each day is a new opportunity to practice and get closer to your goal. 

### 3. Suggested Strategies  
1. **Set Specific Break Times**: Schedule specific times during the day when you allow yourself to check social media, and use a timer to stick to it. This can help prevent extended, unplanned usage.
2. **App Tracking and Alerts**: Use built-in features on your smartphone or third-party apps to alert you when you've reached your self-imposed daily limit on social media usage. This can increase awareness and help you stay within your limits.
